# Chromium keyboard shortcuts for opening bookmarks
We found that keyboard shortcuts for the bookmark's bar can be really cool and helping.

## WHY
We found many solutions implementing JS extensions, but unfortunately all of them were kind of suck,
Due to the fact that the bookmarks API to JS extensions is missing the feature of folders.
That means, that you can't open folders (an UI windows).
This led JS solutions to use ugly ideas such as creating everything in their own UI.
Our goal is to solve that problem!

## HOWTO
[Pull chromium code](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code), checkout to commit 328303c149dbdcdb41f251cd70abc0fbbce0f2e8 and format our ChromiumkeyboardShortcutsBookmarks.patch.

We are hoping that Chromium team will accept our code as soon as possible :>
